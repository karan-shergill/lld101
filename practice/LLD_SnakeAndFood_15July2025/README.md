# LLM Suggested Improvements

### Missing Snake Model
Create a dedicated Snake class:
```java
public class Snake {
    private Deque<Cell> body;
    private Cell head;
    private Direction currentDirection;
    
    public void move(Direction direction, Board board) { /* ... */ }
    public boolean checkSelfCollision() { /* ... */ }
    public void grow() { /* ... */ }
}
```

### Missing Features

1. Score Display: Score only shown at end
2. Snake Length Display: No visual length indicator

### **Design Patterns Well Implemented**
1. **Factory Pattern**: Clean food creation
2. **Singleton Pattern**: Board management
3. **Strategy Pattern**: Extensible food types
4. **Interface Segregation**: Games interface for future games

### **Solid OOP Principles**
1. **Encapsulation**: Proper data hiding in all classes
2. **Abstraction**: Abstract Food class with concrete implementations
3. **Inheritance**: Food hierarchy is clean and extensible
4. **Polymorphism**: Different food behaviors through method overriding

### **Clean Architecture**
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each package has distinct responsibility
2. **Utility Functions**: Game logic separated from core classes
3. **Constants Management**: Enums for game states and types
4. **Error Handling**: Input validation and collision detection

### Ready for Enhancement
Your code is now solid enough to add advanced features:
1. Game Speed Control: Add timing between moves
2. Multiple Levels: Increase difficulty over time
3. Power-ups: Temporary effects from special foods
4. AI Player: Computer-controlled snake
5. High Scores: Persistent score storage
