## Design Patterns Used

### 1. **Singleton Pattern**
- **Implementation**: `InventoryManager.getInstance()`
- **Purpose**: Ensures single point of control for entire inventory system
- **Benefit**: Centralized coordination and consistent state management across warehouses
- **Thread Safety**: Synchronized method for concurrent access

```java
public static synchronized InventoryManager getInstance(ReplenishmentStrategy replenishmentStrategy) {
    if (inventoryManagerInstance == null) {
        inventoryManagerInstance = new InventoryManager(replenishmentStrategy);
    }
    return inventoryManagerInstance;
}
```

### 2. **Builder Pattern**
- **Implementation**: Product-specific builders (`GroceryBuilder`, `ElectronicsBuilder`, `ClothingBuilder`)
- **Purpose**: Complex product creation with optional parameters and type-specific attributes
- **Benefit**: Flexible object creation with readable, maintainable code

```java
Grocery milk = new GroceryBuilder()
    .setSku("GR001")
    .setName("Organic Milk")
    .setPrice(4.99)
    .setQuantity(50)
    .setThreshold(15)
    .setExpirationDate(new Date())
    .setNeedRefrigeration(true)
    .build();
```

### 3. **Director Pattern**
- **Implementation**: `ProductDirector` manages the building process
- **Purpose**: Encapsulates construction logic and provides convenient creation methods
- **Benefit**: Consistent product creation with business rule validation

```java
public class ProductDirector {
    public Grocery createGroceryProduct(String sku, String name, double price, 
                                       int quantity, int threshold, ProductCategory category,
                                       Date expirationDate, boolean needRefrigeration) {
        return new GroceryBuilder()
            .setSku(sku)
            .setName(name)
            // ... other properties
            .build();
    }
}
```

### 4. **Observer Pattern**
- **Implementation**: `InventoryObserver` interface with `DashboardAlertSystem` and `SupplierNotifier`
- **Purpose**: Real-time notifications when inventory levels change
- **Benefit**: Loose coupling between inventory changes and notification systems

```java
public interface InventoryObserver {
    void update(Product product, String warehouseName);
}
// Automatic notifications when stock falls below threshold
```

### 5. **Strategy Pattern**
- **Implementation**: `ReplenishmentStrategy` interface with multiple algorithms
- **Purpose**: Interchangeable replenishment strategies for different business needs
- **Benefit**: Runtime strategy switching and easy addition of new algorithms

```java
// Different replenishment strategies
ReplenishmentStrategy bulkOrder = new BulkOrderStrategy();
ReplenishmentStrategy justInTime = new JustInTimeStrategy();
inventoryManager.setReplenishmentStrategy(bulkOrder);
```

## OOP Principles Followed

### 1. **Encapsulation**
- **Private Fields**: Product details, warehouse inventory, observer lists, strategy implementations
- **Public Methods**: Controlled access through well-defined interfaces
- **Data Hiding**: Internal inventory calculations and notification logic hidden from clients

### 2. **Inheritance**
- **Base Classes**: Abstract `Product` class with common attributes
- **Derived Classes**: `Grocery`, `Electronics`, `Clothing` with specialized features
- **Interface Hierarchy**: Builder interfaces and observer interfaces for consistent contracts

### 3. **Polymorphism**
- **Runtime Polymorphism**: Different replenishment strategies through common interface
- **Builder Polymorphism**: Product-specific builders with common building process
- **Observer Polymorphism**: Multiple notification types through observer interface

### 4. **Abstraction**
- **Abstract Classes**: `Product` defines common product behavior
- **Interfaces**: `ReplenishmentStrategy`, `InventoryObserver`, `ProductBuilder` abstract behavior
- **Enums**: Abstract business constants (ProductCategory)

## Data Structures & Algorithms

### Data Structures Used

1. **HashMap** (`Map<String, Product>`)
   - **Purpose**: Fast SKU-based product lookup within warehouses
   - **Time Complexity**: O(1) for get/put operations
   - **Why Used**: Instant product retrieval by SKU for inventory operations

2. **ArrayList** (`List<Warehouse>`, `List<InventoryObserver>`)
   - **Purpose**: Dynamic collections of warehouses and observers
   - **Time Complexity**: O(1) for access, O(n) for search operations
   - **Why Used**: Flexible collections with easy iteration and management

3. **Custom Objects**
   - **Product**: Represents inventory items with business attributes
   - **Warehouse**: Manages product collections with location information
   - **ProductLocation**: Links products to their warehouse locations

4. **Enums**
   - **ProductCategory**: Type-safe product classification
   - **Business Constants**: Standardized category and type definitions

### Algorithms Used

1. **Inventory Threshold Monitoring Algorithm**
   - **Time Complexity**: O(1) per operation
   - **Logic**: Real-time threshold checking with observer notifications
   ```java
   if (productToCheck.getQuantity() <= productToCheck.getThreshold()) {
       notifyObservers(productToCheck);
   }
   ```

2. **Cross-Warehouse Search Algorithm**
   - **Time Complexity**: O(w) where w = number of warehouses
   - **Logic**: Parallel search across all warehouse locations
   ```java
   for (Warehouse warehouse : warehouses) {
       Product product = warehouse.getProductBySku(sku);
       if (product != null) {
           locations.add(new ProductLocation(warehouse, product));
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Replenishment Strategy Algorithm**
   - **Time Complexity**: O(1) for strategy execution
   - **Logic**: Strategy pattern with business rule application
   ```java
   if (product.getQuantity() < product.getThreshold()) {
       replenishmentStrategy.replenishment(product);
   }
   ```

4. **Product Builder Algorithm**
   - **Time Complexity**: O(1) per property setting
   - **Logic**: Fluent interface with method chaining
   ```java
   return new GroceryBuilder()
       .setSku(sku)
       .setName(name)
       .setPrice(price)
       // ... chain continues
       .build();
   ```

5. **Observer Notification Algorithm**
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n = number of observers
   - **Logic**: Broadcast notifications to all registered observers
   ```java
   for (InventoryObserver observer : observers) {
       observer.update(product, this.name);
   }
   ```
