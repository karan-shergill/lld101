# Snake and food 

## Leaning

- Snake and food  has a lot of open-ended questions/requirements that need to be clarified with the interviwere
  - Food will load randomly or will be preloaded.
  - Once snake collide with the wall, will he appears from opposite wall or die.
- We can have different kind of food items shown initialize via factory design pattern.
- Its a great idea to have a game status enum

# LLM Model Feedback
## **Strengths** ðŸŸ¢

### 1. **Good Design Patterns Implementation**
- **Strategy Pattern**: Well-implemented for movement strategies (`HumanMovementStrategy`, `AIMovementStrategy`)
- **Factory Pattern**: Properly used for food creation with different food types
- **Singleton Pattern**: Applied for the Board class to ensure single instance

### 2. **Proper Separation of Concerns**
- Clear package structure with logical grouping
- Game logic separated from UI/input handling
- Movement logic abstracted into strategies

### 3. **Extensible Architecture**
- Easy to add new food types through factory pattern
- New movement strategies can be added without modifying existing code
- Good use of enums for `GameStatus` and `Directions`

### 4. **Efficient Data Structures**
- Using `Deque<Cell>` for snake body (efficient head/tail operations)
- Using `HashMap` for O(1) position lookup to check self-collision

## **Areas for Improvement** ðŸ”´

### 1. **Critical Design Issues**

#### **Cell Class Missing equals() and hashCode()**
```java
// Current Cell class lacks proper equality methods
public class Cell {
    private int row;
    private int col;
    // Missing equals() and hashCode() - Critical for HashMap usage!
}
```

**Impact**: This will cause incorrect collision detection since `HashMap.containsKey()` relies on these methods.

#### **Food Factory Not Integrated**
The food factory is implemented but **never used** in the game logic. The game uses simple `Cell[]` instead of `FoodItem[]`.

### 2. **Game Logic Issues**

#### **Incomplete Food System**
- Food points are calculated but never applied to scoring
- Different food types (poisonous, super) have no gameplay effect
- No food respawning mechanism

#### **Limited AI Strategy**
```java
// AIMovementStrategy is naive and will cause immediate game over
return allFourDirections.get(random.nextInt(allFourDirections.size()));
```
The AI doesn't consider boundaries or self-collision, making it unplayable.

### 3. **Missing Core Features**

#### **No Visual Representation**
- No actual board rendering
- Only text-based score display
- Cannot see snake position or food location

#### **No Game Save/Load**
- `GameStatus.SAVED` exists but save functionality is missing
- No persistence mechanism

### 4. **Code Quality Issues**

#### **Bug in Food Position Initialization**
```java
private Cell[] getFoodPosition(int[][] foodPosition) {
    Cell[] foodPos = new Cell[foodPosition.length];
    int i = 0;
    for (int j=0; j<foodPosition.length; j++) {
        foodPos[i] = new Cell(foodPosition[j][0], foodPosition[j][1]);
        // i is never incremented! This only fills index 0
    }
    return foodPos;
}
```

#### **Unused Direction Parameter**
```java
public Cell getNextPosition(Cell currHeadPosition, Directions direction) {
    // In AIMovementStrategy, direction parameter is completely ignored
}
```

## **Recommendations** ðŸ”§

### 1. **High Priority Fixes**

#### **Fix Cell Class**
```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if (this == obj) return true;
    if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
    Cell cell = (Cell) obj;
    return row == cell.row && col == cell.col;
}

@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return Objects.hash(row, col);
}
```

#### **Integrate Food Factory**
```java
// In SnakeAndFoodGame constructor
private FoodItem[] initializeFoodItems(int[][] foodPositions) {
    FoodItem[] foods = new FoodItem[foodPositions.length];
    for (int i = 0; i < foodPositions.length; i++) {
        Cell position = new Cell(foodPositions[i][0], foodPositions[i][1]);
        foods[i] = FoodFactory.getFood(FoodItemType.NORMAL, position);
    }
    return foods;
}
```

### 2. **Architecture Enhancements**

#### **Add Board Renderer**
```java
public interface BoardRenderer {
    void render(Board board, Snake snake, FoodItem[] foods);
}
```

#### **Implement Proper Scoring System**
```java
public class ScoreManager {
    private int score = 0;
    
    public void addPoints(int points) {
        this.score += points;
    }
    
    public int getScore() {
        return score;
    }
}
```

### 3. **Game Logic Improvements**

#### **Smarter AI Strategy**
```java
// Consider boundary checking and collision avoidance
public Cell getNextPosition(Cell currHeadPosition, Directions direction) {
    // Implement pathfinding or at least boundary-aware movement
}
```

#### **Dynamic Food Generation**
```java
public void generateNewFood() {
    // Randomly place food in empty cells
    // Consider food type distribution
}
```

## **Interview Performance Assessment** ðŸ“Š

**Strengths**:
- Good understanding of design patterns
- Clean code structure
- Proper enum usage

**Concerns**:
- Critical bugs that would cause runtime issues
- Incomplete feature implementation
- Missing integration between components

**Overall**: You demonstrate good design thinking, but attention to detail and integration testing would significantly improve the implementation quality.

## Missing Features ðŸ“‹
- Visual Display: No actual board rendering - only shows score
- Game Persistence: SAVED status exists but no save/load functionality
- Score System: Food points are calculated but not integrated
- Game Configuration: No difficulty levels or customizable settings
- Input Validation: No validation for user input
- Performance: No optimizations for large boards

## Interview Readiness ðŸ’¼
- Questions You Should Be Prepared For:
- "How would you handle different food effects (poison, super food)?"
- "What if we want to add multiplayer support?"
- "How would you implement different game modes?"
- "Explain your choice of data structures for the snake body"
- "How would you add game persistence?"

## Extension Points to Discuss:
- Observer Pattern: For game state notifications
- Command Pattern: For undo/redo functionality
- State Pattern: For different game states
- Decorator Pattern: For power-ups and effects

## **Next Steps** ðŸŽ¯

1. **Fix the critical bugs** (Cell equals/hashCode, food positioning)
2. **Complete the food system integration**
3. **Add visual board representation**
4. **Implement proper AI logic**
5. **Add unit tests** to catch such issues early

Would you like me to help implement any of these specific improvements?
